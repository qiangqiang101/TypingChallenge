Neither would give way, and so they both fell, to be swept away by the roaring torrent below.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.\n\n\n\nIf he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a stupid Dog he had been.</Phrase>

The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.\n\n\n\nThe bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.\n\n\n\nNow he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.\n\n\n\n"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."\n\n\n\nAnd off he walked very, very scornfully.</Phrase>

The Leopard was about to lose his temper when the Fox got up, yawning lazily.\n\n\n\n"You may have a very smart coat," he said, "but you would be a great deal better off if you had a little more smartness inside your head and less on your ribs, the way I am.

Then, toward nightfall, he heard the Mother's voice again as she sat down near the window to sing and rock her baby to sleep.\n\n\n\n"There, child, there! The Wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill him if he should come near!"\n\n\n\nJust then the Father came within sight of the home, and the Wolf was barely able to save himself from the Dogs by a clever bit of running.</Phrase>

He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate. So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his domains within twenty-four hours.\n\n\n\nThe command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about the fearful Lion.\n\n\n\nAnd when he came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine, and there saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears, a terrible fright seized him.\n\n\n\n"Goodby, neighbor Cricket," he called. "I'm off. He will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say."</Phrase>

So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.\n\n\n\nThe Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.\n\n\n\nThe Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.</Phrase>

The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.\n\n\n\nNext year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap.\n\n\n\nNow the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause. And they say that ever after, while the Eagle's eggs lie in the nest in spring, the Beetle still sleeps in the ground. For so Jupiter commanded.</Phrase>

      <Level>54</Level>
      <Phrase>A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked:\n\n\n\n"Won't you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do."\n\n\n\nThe Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help.\n\n\n\nThe Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>The Fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the Stork, at whose odd appearance he was always laughing.\n\n\n\n"You must come and dine with me today," he said to the Stork, smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play. The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite.\n\n\n\nFor dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get. But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show of enjoyment.\n\n\n\nThe hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly:\n\n\n\nDo not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.\n\n\n\n"No need to search any farther," thought sly Master Fox. "Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast."\n\n\n\nUp he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, "Good-morning, beautiful creature!"\n\n\n\nThe Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting.\n\n\n\n"What a charming creature she is!" said the Fox. "How her feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds."\n\n\n\nListening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth.\n\n\n\n"Thank you," said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. "Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?"</Phrase>

      <Phrase>There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone.\n\n\n\nHe was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf!\n\n\n\nThe Kid knew there was little hope for him.\n\n\n\n"Please, Mr. Wolf," he said trembling, "I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can."\n\n\n\nThe Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited.\n\n\n\nAfter many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along.\n\n\n\nOne day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.\n\n\n\n"We can help you to see the world," said the Ducks. "Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry."\n\n\n\nThe Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds.\n\n\n\nJust then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried:\n\n\n\n"This must surely be the King of Tortoises!"\n\n\n\n"Why certainly—" began the Tortoise.\n\n\n\nBut as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of.\n\n\n\nAt nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably.\n\n\n\nWith the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely:\n\n\n\n"A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends."\n\n\n\n"I feel highly flattered, kind sir," replied the Cock slyly. "If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in."\n\n\n\nThe hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.</Phrase>

But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he was very much afraid of the Fox.\n\n\n\n"Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event."\n\n\n\n"How grand!" said the Cock. "I certainly am delighted at the news."

      <Level>66</Level>
      <Phrase>A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.\n\n\n\nAfter the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.\n\n\n\nThe Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.\n\n\n\n"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not," she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."</Phrase>

One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window.\n\n\n\n"Get away from here, sir," she said to the Grasshopper. "Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!"\n\n\n\nBut the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.\n\n\n\nThe wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him.\n\n\n\n"Well sir," she said, "if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself."\n\n\n\nThe foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely. She lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services. So she made shift to get on, and always looked as spry and cheery as if she had not a want in the world.\n\n\n\nNow one summer evening, as she was trotting, full of smiles as ever, along the high road to her hovel, what should she see but a big black pot lying in the ditch!\n\n\n\n"Goodness me!" she cried, "that would be just the very thing for me if I only had something to put in it! But I haven't! Now who could have left it in the ditch?"\n\n\n\nAnd she looked about her expecting the owner would not be far off; but she could see nobody.\n\n\n\n"Maybe there is a hole in it," she went on, "and that's why it has been cast away. But it would do fine to put a flower in for my window; so I'll just take it home with me."\n\n\n\nAnd with that she lifted the lid and looked inside. "Mercy me!" she cried, fair amazed. "If it isn't full of gold pieces. Here's luck!"\n\n\n\nAnd so it was, brimful of great gold coins. Well, at first she simply stood stock-still, wondering if she was standing on her head or her heels. Then she began saying:\n\n\n\n"Lawks! But I do feel rich. I feel awful rich!"\n\n\n\nAfter she had said this many times, she began to wonder how she was to get her treasure home. It was too heavy for her to carry, and she could see no better way than to tie the end of her shawl to it and drag it behind her like a go-cart.\n\n\n\n"It will soon be dark," she said to herself as she trotted along. "So much the better! The neighbours will not see what I'm bringing home, and I shall have all the night to myself, and be able to think what I'll do! Mayhap I'll buy a grand house and just sit by the fire with a cup o' tea and do no work at all like a queen. Or maybe I'll bury it at the garden foot and just keep a bit in the old china teapot on the chimney-piece. Or maybe—Goody! Goody! I feel that grand I don't know myself."\n\n\n\nBy this time she was a bit tired of dragging such a heavy weight, and, stopping to rest a while, turned to look at her treasure.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>And lo! it wasn't a pot of gold at all! It was nothing but a lump of silver.\n\n\n\nShe stared at it, and rubbed her eyes, and stared at it again.\n\n\n\n"Well! I never!" she said at last. "And me thinking it was a pot of gold! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! Silver is far less trouble—easier to mind, and not so easy stolen. Them gold pieces would have been the death o' me, and with this great lump of silver—"\n\n\n\nSo she went off again planning what she would do, and feeling as rich as rich, until becoming a bit tired again she stopped to rest and gave a look round to see if her treasure was safe; and she saw nothing but a great lump of iron!\n\n\n\n"Well! I never!" says she again. "And I mistaking it for silver! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! It's real convenient. I can get penny pieces for old iron, and penny pieces are a deal handier for me than your gold and silver. Why! I should never have slept a wink for fear of being robbed. But a penny piece comes in useful, and I shall sell that iron for a lot and be real rich—rolling rich."\n\n\n\nSo on she trotted full of plans as to how she would spend her penny pieces, till once more she stopped to rest and looked round to see her treasure was safe. And this time she saw nothing but a big stone.\n\n\n\n"Well! I never!" she cried, full of smiles. "And to think I mistook it for iron. I must have been dreaming. But here's luck indeed, and me wanting a stone terrible bad to stick open the gate. Eh my! but it's a change for the better! It's a fine thing to have good luck."\n\n\n\nSo, all in a hurry to see how the stone would keep the gate open, she trotted off down the hill till she came to her own cottage. She unlatched the gate and then turned to unfasten her shawl from the stone which lay on the path behind her. Aye! It was a stone sure enough. There was plenty light to see it lying there, douce and peaceable as a stone should.\n\n\n\nSo she bent over it to unfasten the shawl end, when—"Oh my!" All of a sudden it gave a jump, a squeal, and in one moment was as big as a haystack. Then it let down four great lanky legs and threw out two long ears, nourished a great long tail and romped off, kicking and squealing and whinnying and laughing like a naughty, mischievous boy!\n\n\n\nThe old woman stared after it till it was fairly out of sight, then she burst out laughing too.\n\n\n\n"Well!" she chuckled, "I am in luck! Quite the luckiest body hereabouts. Fancy my seeing the Bogey-Beast all to myself; and making myself so free with it too! My goodness! I do feel that uplifted—that GRAND!"—\n\n\n\nSo she went into her cottage and spent the evening chuckling over her good luck.</Phrase>

      <Phrase>The most important thing we've learned, so far as children are concerned,\n\nis never, NEVER, NEVER let them near your television set -- or better still, just don't install the idiotic thing at all. In almost every house we've been, we've watched them gaping at the screen. They loll and slop and lounge about, and stare until their eyes pop out. (Last week in someone's place we saw a dozen eyeballs on the floor.) They sit and stare and stare and sit until they're hypnotised by it, until they're absolutely drunk with all that shocking ghastly junk. Oh yes, we know it keeps them still, they don't climb out the window sill, they never fight or kick or punch, they leave you free to cook the lunch and wash the dishes in the sink -- But did you ever stop to think, to wonder just exactly what this does to your beloved tot?\n\nIT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!\n\nIT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!\n\nIT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!\n\nIT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND\n\nHE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND\n\nA FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!\n\nHIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!\n\nHIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!\n\nHE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES!\n\n'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say, 'But if we take the set away, what shall we do to entertain our darling children? Please explain!' We'll answer this by asking you, 'What used the darling ones to do? 'How used they keep themselves contented before this monster was invented?' Have you forgotten? Don't you know? We'll say it very loud and slow:\n\nTHEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ,\n\nAND READ and READ, and then proceed to READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks! One half their lives was reading books! The nursery shelves held books galore! Books cluttered up the nursery floor! And in the bedroom, by the bed, more books were waiting to be read! Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales and treasure isles, and distant shores where smugglers rowed with muffled oars, and pirates wearing purple pants, and sailing ships and elephants, and cannibals crouching 'round the pot, stirring away at something hot.\n\n(It smells so good, what can it be? good gracious, it's Penelope.)\n\nThe younger ones had Beatrix Potter with Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter, and Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland, and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and just How The Camel Got His Hump, and How the Monkey Lost His Rump, and Mr. Toad, and bless my soul, there's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole- Oh, books, what books they used to know, those children living long ago! So please, oh please, we beg, we pray, go throw your TV set away, and in its place you can install a lovely bookshelf on the wall. Then fill the shelves with lots of books, ignoring all the dirty looks, the screams and yells, the bites and kicks, and children hitting you with sticks. Fear not, because we promise you that, in about a week or two of having nothing else to do, they'll now begin to feel the need of having something to read. And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy! You watch the slowly growing joy that fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen they'll wonder what they'd ever seen in that ridiculous machine, that nauseating, foul, unclean, repulsive television screen! And later, each and every kid will love you more for what you did.</Phrase>
